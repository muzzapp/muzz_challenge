# Muzz Explore Service (Pair Programming Exercise)

This repository contains a basic "explore" service used for pair programming interviews at Muzz.

## Overview

- The service is designed to simulate a simple user exploration and matching system.
- There is a repository layer with integration tests prepared for database interactions.
- A list of unit tests is provided for the server level, which you are encouraged to implement.

## What We're Looking For

We do **not** expect candidates to finish everything. We're interested in your thought process, how you approach problems, and how you communicate your reasoning.

## Database Options

You can choose to use either **SQL** or **DynamoDB** as the backing database. Integration tests can make use of [testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go) to spin up the required database for testing.

## Getting Started

- Explore the repo layer and review the integration tests.
- Implement server-level unit tests as you see fit.
- Use the database technology/technologies you believe is most suitable.

## Notes

- The exercise is intentionally open-ended.
- Focus on clear communication, code structure, and problem-solving.
- Feel free to ask questions or discuss trade-offs as you work.
- This is an open book exercise, so you can refer to documentation and resources as needed. (It is fine to not remember how to structure a DDb query off the top of your head)

Good luck and have fun!
